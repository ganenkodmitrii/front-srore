# `src/business`

You can use this folder to keep the types, utils and other logic which is specific to this application

## Examples

- Formatting prices based on currency, e.g. `Currency` enum, `formatPriceWithCurrency` util, and mappings for used symbols

The helper types related to JS keep in `src/types` (e.g. `RecursivePartial<T>`), same for utilities in `src/utils` (e.g. `capitalize` for strings)
